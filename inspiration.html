		<p> 
			<p> Melanie is a big inspiration towards others all around the world. She has worked hard to get where she is right now.She wasn't on any kind of TV series, nor did she have anyone famous in her family.She is not afraid to be herself. She keeps things real and that's why people love her.Her music speaks to people.After dropping her first debuted album she hasn't changed since.She fully supports diversity and originality.Her music has helped people stop doing harmful things to themsleves and has taught us (crybabies) to love ourselves.She has helped many of us by her music.She is just an amzaing person and I can't wait to see what she does after her tour.</p>
