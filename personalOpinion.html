                Trigger warning: Self harm
                Melanie has helped me over come many things over the year. For example in middle school I had some really bad times, my mom left amd was a drunk and she negelct me and I was in a really bad mind state. I didnt think I would get out of it. In those times listening to melanie and prince the veil,etc has helped me. Melanie music means something to, I just cant explane it. She has inspired me to be myself and not care about what others think.She is and idol to all and more people discover her everyday.
